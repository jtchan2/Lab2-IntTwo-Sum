# Lab2-IntTwo-Sum
Justin Chan

THis is my submission for Lab 2 assignment
In the occurance where the target sum could not be found, I added a line where it states No valid nums can equal target
or same num cannot add to each oterh because i didn't know if the code had also take care of the isntance where the sum cannot be found from the array at all
